# About

This simple program can be used against website with modifications of course.
passwords.txt contains common passwords.
However, most sites will have firewalls or captchas so workarounds are needed probably.
For firewalls, one may want to use a proxy server or use VPN to "change" one's IP address after getting banned for exceeding
the max number of incorrect login attempts.
